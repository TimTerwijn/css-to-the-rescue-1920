## Limits
### For this project I decided to limit myself with the following things:
* I wanted to learn print-stylesheets.  
* I wanted to use less than 5kb CSS.  
* I did not want to make use of squares, rectangles, circles, triangles.  
* I did not want to use any ID's or Classes at all.  

## Learning Goals
* I want to learn to work with print style sheets.  
* I want to learn to work with Grids.  
* I want to learn how SVG's work.   
* I want to make use of all the CSS selectors, instead of the usual classes and id's.  
* I want to learn how you do a click event without javascript.  

## How to use
Clone or download the repository $ git clone https://github.com/TimTerwijn/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git.   
Go to index.html in your browses.  
Hover any item to see the prices and animations.  
Click any item to see the awesome **lazerbeams**.
Print the page to print the awesome menu with different styling than the main page.  

## WishList
* Faces wobbles
* More lazers
* Flipping cards
* Eyes following mouse
